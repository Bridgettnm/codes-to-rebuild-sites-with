'''reCAPTCHA''' is a [[CAPTCHA]] system that enables web hosts to distinguish between human and automated access to websites. The original version asked users to decipher hard to read text or match images. Version 2 also asked users to decipher text or match images if the analysis of cookies and canvas rendering suggested the page was being downloaded automatically.<ref name="No CAPTCHA">{{cite web |last=Shet |first=Vinay |date=December 3, 2014 |title=Are&nbsp;you a robot?

The original iteration of the service was a [[mass collaboration]] platform designed for the digitization of books, particularly those that were too illegible to be [[Optical character recognition|scanned by computers]]. The verification prompts utilized pairs of words from scanned pages, with one known word used as a control for verification, and the second used to [[crowdsourcing|crowdsource]] the reading of an uncertain word.<ref>{{Citation|last=Ahn|first=Luis von|title=Massive-scale online collaboration|date=December 6, 2011 |url=https://www.ted.com/talks/luis_von_ahn_massive_scale_online_collaboration|language=en|access-date=2020-04-14|archive-date=July 15, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200715092310/https://www.ted.com/talks/luis_von_ahn_massive_scale_online_collaboration|url-status=live}}</ref> reCAPTCHA was originally developed by [[Luis von Ahn]], David Abraham, [[Manuel Blum]], Michael Crawford, Ben Maurer, Colin McMillen, and Edison Tan at [[Carnegie Mellon University|Carnegie Mellon University's]] main [[Pittsburgh]] campus.<ref>{{Cite web|title = reCAPTCHA: About Us|url=http://recaptcha.net/aboutus.html | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100611210259/http://recaptcha.net/aboutus.html|access-date = 2018-08-14 | archive-date=2010-06-11}}</ref> It was acquired by [[Google]] in September 2009.<ref name="AutoK4-1" /> The system helped to digitize the archives of ''[[The New York Times]]'', and was subsequently used by [[Google Books]] for similar purposes.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/29/science/29recaptcha.html|title=Deciphering Old Texts, One Woozy, Curvy Word at a Time|date=March 28, 2011|work=The New York Times|access-date=November 20, 2017|archive-date=November 17, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171117172409/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/29/science/29recaptcha.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

The system was reported as displaying over 100&nbsp;million CAPTCHAs every day,<ref name="AutoK4-2" /> on sites such as [[Facebook]], [[TicketMaster]], [[Twitter]], [[4chan]], [[CNN.com]], [[StumbleUpon]],<ref name="BBCreport" /> [[Craigslist]] (since June 2008),<ref name="craig" /> and the U.S. [[National Telecommunications and Information Administration]]'s [[CECB|digital TV converter box]] coupon program website (as part of the [[DTV transition in the United States|US DTV transition]]).<ref name="AutoK4-5" />

In 2014, Google pivoted the service away from its original concept, with a focus on reducing the amount of user interaction needed to verify a user, and only presenting human recognition challenges (such as identifying images in a set that satisfy a specific prompt) if behavioral analysis suspects that the user may be a bot.

== Origin ==
[[Distributed Proofreaders]] was the first project to volunteer its time to decipher scanned text that could not be read by [[optical character recognition]] (OCR) programs. It works with [[Project Gutenberg]] to digitize [[public domain]] material and uses methods quite different from reCAPTCHA.

The reCAPTCHA program originated with [[Guatemala]]n [[computer scientist]] [[Luis von Ahn]],<ref name="CBC2" /> and was aided by a [[MacArthur Fellowship]]. An early CAPTCHA developer, he realized "he had unwittingly created a system that was frittering away, in ten-second increments, millions of hours of a most precious resource: human brain cycles".<ref name="AutoK4-9" />

== Operation ==
=== ReCAPTCHA v1 (human-assisted OCR) ===
[[File:Modern-captcha.jpg|thumb|290px|An example of how a reCAPTCHA challenge looked in 2007,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2007/09/16/recaptcha-using-captchas-to-digitize-books/|title=reCAPTCHA: Using Captchas To Digitize Books|website=[[TechCrunch]]|date=2007-09-16}}</ref> containing the words "following" and "finding". The waviness and horizontal stroke were added to increase the difficulty of breaking the CAPTCHA with a computer program.]]

Scanned text is subjected to analysis by two different OCRs. Any word that is deciphered differently by the two OCR programs or that is not in an English dictionary is marked as "suspicious" and converted into a CAPTCHA. The suspicious word is displayed, out of context, sometimes along with a control word already known. If the human types the control word correctly, then the response to the questionable word is accepted as probably valid. If enough users were to correctly type the control word, but incorrectly type the second word which OCR had failed to recognize, then the digital version of documents could end up containing the incorrect word. The identification performed by each OCR program is given a value of 0.5 points, and each interpretation by a human is given a full point. Once a given identification hits 2.5 points, the word is considered valid. Those words that are consistently given a single identity by human judges are later recycled as control words.<ref name="AutoK4-8" /> If the first three guesses match each other but do not match either of the OCRs, they are considered a correct answer, and the word becomes a control word.<ref name="Ahn, Ben Maurer 2008">{{cite journal | last1 = Luis | last2 = Maurer | first2 = Ben | last3 = McMillen | first3 = Colin | last4 = Abraham | first4 = David | last5 = Blum | first5 = Manuel | year = 2008 | title = reCAPTCHA: Human-Based Character Recognition via Web Security Measures" | journal = Science | volume = 321 | issue = 5895| pages = 1465â€“1468 | doi = 10.1126/science.1160379 | pmid = 18703711 | bibcode = 2008Sci...321.1465V | citeseerx =  10.1.1.141.6563| s2cid = 18371056 }}</ref> When six users reject a word before any correct spelling is chosen, the word is discarded as unreadable.<ref name="Ahn, Ben Maurer 2008" />

The original reCAPTCHA method was designed to show the questionable words separately, as out-of-context correction, rather than in use, such as within a phrase of five words from the original document.<ref name="DM" /> Also, the control word might mislead context for the second word, such as a request of "/metal/ /fife/" being entered as "metal [[File (tool)|file]]" due to the logical connection of filing with a metal tool being considered more common than the musical instrument "[[fife (instrument)|fife]]".{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

In 2012, reCAPTCHA began using photographs taken from [[Google Street View]] project, in addition to scanned words.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://techcrunch.com/2012/03/29/google-now-using-recaptcha-to-decode-street-view-addresses/ |title=Google Now Using ReCAPTCHA To Decode Street View Addresses |work=TechCrunch |date=March 29, 2012 |access-date=2013-07-10 |first=Sarah |last=Perez |archive-date=August 23, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120823005658/http://techcrunch.com/2012/03/29/google-now-using-recaptcha-to-decode-street-view-addresses/ |url-status=live }}</ref> It will ask the user to identify images of crosswalks, street lights, and other objects. Some online have speculated if the data was being used by Google's self-driving company, [[Waymo]]. However, this was confirmed to not be the case.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Vega |first=Edward |date=2021-05-14 |title=Why captchas are getting harder |url=https://www.vox.com/22436832/captchas-getting-harder-ai-artificial-intelligence |access-date=2022-04-15 |website=Vox |language=en}}</ref>

=== No CAPTCHA reCAPTCHA (v2+) ===
[[File:NoCAPTCHA reCAPTCHA.gif|thumb|The NoCAPTCHA reCAPTCHA]]
In 2013, reCAPTCHA began implementing [[behavioral analysis]] of the browser's interactions to predict whether the user was a human or a bot. The following year, Google began to deploy a new reCAPTCHA  API, featuring the "no CAPTCHA reCAPTCHA" â€” where users deemed to be of low risk only need to click a single [[checkbox]] to verify their identity. A CAPTCHA may still be presented if the system is uncertain of the user's risk; Google also introduced a new type of CAPTCHA challenge designed to be more accessible to mobile users, where the user must select images matching a specific prompt from a grid.<ref name="No CAPTCHA" /><ref name="oneclick">{{cite magazine|last=Greenberg|first=Andy|date=December 3, 2014|title=Google Can Now Tell You're Not a Robot with Just One Click|url=https://www.wired.com/2014/12/google-one-click-recaptcha/|magazine=[[Wired (website)|Wired]]|access-date=October 1, 2015|archive-date=October 2, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151002161845/http://www.wired.com/2014/12/google-one-click-recaptcha/|url-status=live}}</ref>  

In 2017, Google introduced a new "invisible" reCAPTCHA, where verification occurs in the background, and no challenges are displayed at all if the user is deemed to be of low risk.<ref name="Fast Company" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2017/03/googles-recaptcha-announces-invisible-background-captchas/|title=Google's reCAPTCHA turns "invisible," will separate bots from people without challenges|last=Amadeo|first=Ron|date=2017-03-09|website=Ars Technica|language=en-us|access-date=2020-04-14|archive-date=August 6, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200806153852/https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2017/03/googles-recaptcha-announces-invisible-background-captchas/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=":1" /> According to former Google "[[click fraud]] czar" [[Shuman Ghosemajumder]], this capability "creates a new sort of challenge that very advanced bots can still get around, but introduces a lot less friction to the legitimate human."<ref name=":1">{{cite magazine | url=http://www.popsci.com/google-invisible-recaptcha#page-3 | title=Google just made the internet a tiny bit less annoying | magazine=[[Popular Science]] | date=March 10, 2017 | access-date=2017-04-05 | archive-date=February 5, 2021 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210205012217/https://www.popsci.com/google-invisible-recaptcha/#page-3 | url-status=live }}</ref>

== Implementation ==
The reCAPTCHA tests are displayed from the central site of the reCAPTCHA project, which supplies the words to be deciphered.  This is done through a [[JavaScript]] [[Application programming interface|API]] with the server making a callback to reCAPTCHA after the request has been submitted.  The reCAPTCHA project provides libraries for various programming languages and applications to make this process easier. reCAPTCHA is a free-of-charge service provided to websites for assistance with the decipherment,<ref name="FAQ" /> but the reCAPTCHA software is not [[open-source software|open-source]].<ref name="google">{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/recaptcha|title=reCAPTCHA: Stop Spam, Read Books|access-date=2014-01-14|archive-date=June 19, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200619191856/https://www.google.com/recaptcha/|url-status=live}}</ref>

Also, reCAPTCHA offers plugins for several web-application platforms including [[ASP.NET]], [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]], and [[PHP]], to ease the implementation of the service.<ref name="google2">{{cite web|url=https://developers.google.com/recaptcha/intro?csw=1|title=Developer's Guide â€“ reCAPTCHA â€” Google Developers|access-date=2014-01-14|archive-date=November 24, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171124231704/https://developers.google.com/recaptcha/intro?csw=1|url-status=live}}</ref>

== Security ==

The main purpose of a [[CAPTCHA]] system is to block spambots while allowing human users. On December 14, 2009, Jonathan Wilkins released a paper describing weaknesses in reCAPTCHA that allowed bots to achieve a solve rate of 18%.<ref name="Strong CAPTCHA Guidelines" /><ref name="Register Article" /><ref name="H-online Article">{{cite web |url=http://www.h-online.com/security/news/item/Google-s-reCAPTCHA-dented-888859.html |title=Google's reCAPTCHA dented |access-date=January 31, 2011 |archive-date=March 10, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100310082513/http://www.h-online.com/security/news/item/Google-s-reCAPTCHA-dented-888859.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

On August 1, 2010, Chad Houck gave a presentation to the [[DEF CON]] 18 Hacking Conference detailing a method to reverse the distortion added to images which allowed a computer program to determine a valid response 10% of the time.<ref name="Speaker Program" /><ref name="Decoding reCAPTCHA" /> The reCAPTCHA system was modified on July 21, 2010, before Houck was to speak on his method. Houck modified his method to what he described as an "easier" CAPTCHA to determine a valid response 31.8% of the time. Houck also mentioned security defenses in the system, including a high-security lockout if an invalid response is given 32 times in a row.<ref name="Decoding reCAPTCHA pptx" />

On May 26, 2012, Adam, C-P and Jeffball of DC949 gave a presentation at the LayerOne hacker conference detailing how they were able to achieve an automated solution with an accuracy rate of 99.1%.<ref name="Project Stiltwalker" /> Their tactic was to use techniques from machine learning, a subfield of artificial intelligence, to analyse the audio version of reCAPTCHA which is available for the visually impaired. Google released a new version of reCAPTCHA just hours before their talk, making major changes to both the audio and visual versions of their service. In this release, the audio version was increased in length from 8 seconds to 30 seconds, and is much more difficult to understand, both for humans as well as bots. In response to this update and the following one, the members of DC949 released two more versions of Stiltwalker which beat reCAPTCHA with an accuracy of 60.95% and 59.4% respectively. After each successive break, Google updated reCAPTCHA within a few days. According to DC949, they often reverted to features that had been previously hacked.

On June 27, 2012, Claudia Cruz, Fernando Uceda, and Leobardo Reyes published a paper showing a system running on reCAPTCHA images with an accuracy of 82%.<ref>{{cite book|title=Pattern Recognition|volume=7329|date=June 30, 2012|location=MÃ©xico|isbn=978-3-642-31148-2|pages=155â€“165|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-31149-9_16 |author1=Claudia Cruz-Perez|author3=Fernando Uceda-Ponga|author5= Leobardo Reyes-Cabrera|author2=Oleg Starostenko|author4=Vicente Alarcon-Aquino|editor=Carrasco-Ochoa, JesÃºs Ariel |editor2=MartÃ­nez-Trinidad, JosÃ© Francisco |editor3=Olvera LÃ³pez, JosÃ© Arturo |editor4=Boyer, Kim L|chapter=Breaking reCAPTCHAs with Unpredictable Collapse: Heuristic Character Segmentation and Recognition|series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science|s2cid=29097170 }}</ref> The authors have not said if their system can solve recent reCAPTCHA images, although they claim their work to be [[Intelligent character recognition|intelligent OCR]] and robust to some, if not all changes in the image database.

In an August 2012 presentation given at BsidesLV 2012, DC949 called the latest version "unfathomably impossible for humans"&nbsp;â€“ they were not able to solve them manually either.<ref name="Project Stiltwalker" /> The web accessibility organization WebAIM reported in May 2012, "Over 90% of respondents [screen reader users] find CAPTCHA to be very or somewhat difficult."<ref name="webAIM">{{cite web|url=http://webaim.org/projects/screenreadersurvey4/#captcha/|title=Screen Reader User Survey #4 Results|access-date=April 19, 2013|archive-date=December 10, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171210071614/https://webaim.org/projects/screenreadersurvey4/#captcha/|url-status=live}}</ref>

== Criticism ==
The original iteration of reCAPTCHA was criticized as being a source of [[unpaid work]] to assist in transcribing efforts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/boston/blog/techflash/2015/01/massachusetts-womans-lawsuit-accuses-google-of.html|title=Massachusetts woman's lawsuit accuses Google of using free labor to transcribe books, newspapers|last=Harris|first=David L.|date=Jan 23, 2015|website=Boston Business Journal|access-date=September 4, 2015|archive-date=April 28, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150428030942/http://www.bizjournals.com/boston/blog/techflash/2015/01/massachusetts-womans-lawsuit-accuses-google-of.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

=== Privacy ===
The current iteration of the system has been criticized for its reliance on [[tracking cookies]] and promotion of [[vendor lock-in]] with Google services; administrators are encouraged to include reCAPTCHA tracking code in all pages of their website to analyze the behavior and "risk" of users, which determines the level of friction presented when a reCAPTCHA prompt is used. Google stated in its [[privacy policy]] that user data collected in this manner is not used for personalized advertising. It was also discovered that the system favors those who have an active [[Google account]] login, and displays a higher risk towards those using anonymizing proxies and VPN services.<ref name="Fast Company">{{Cite web|url=https://www.fastcompany.com/90369697/googles-new-recaptcha-has-a-dark-side|title=Google's new reCAPTCHA has a dark side|last=Schwab|first=Katharine|date=2019-06-27|website=Fast Company|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-08|archive-date=June 28, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190628221142/https://www.fastcompany.com/90369697/googles-new-recaptcha-has-a-dark-side|url-status=live}}</ref>

Concerns were raised regarding privacy when Google announced reCAPTCHA v3.0, as it allows Google to track users on non-Google websites.<ref name="Fast Company" />

In April 2020, [[Cloudflare]] switched from reCAPTCHA to hCaptcha, citing privacy concerns over Google's potential use of the data they recollect through reCAPTCHA for [[targeted advertising]]<ref>{{Cite web |date=2020-04-08 |title=Moving from reCAPTCHA to hCaptcha |url=https://blog.cloudflare.com/moving-from-recaptcha-to-hcaptcha/ |access-date=2020-07-18 |website=The Cloudflare Blog |language=en |archive-date=August 12, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200812233420/https://blog.cloudflare.com/moving-from-recaptcha-to-hcaptcha/ |url-status=live }}</ref> and to cut down on operating costs since a considerable portion of Cloudflare's customers are free, non-paying customers. In response, Google told [[PC Magazine]] that the data from reCAPTCHA is never used for personalized advertising purposes.<ref name="d">{{Cite web |title=Cloudflare Dumps Google's ReCAPTCHA Over Privacy Concerns, Costs |url=https://www.pcmag.com/news/cloudflare-dumps-googles-recaptcha-over-privacy-concerns-costs |access-date=2020-07-18 |website=PCMAG |language=en |archive-date=July 19, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200719214415/https://www.pcmag.com/news/cloudflare-dumps-googles-recaptcha-over-privacy-concerns-costs |url-status=live }}</ref>

=== Accessibility ===
Google's help center states that reCAPTCHA is not [[accessibility|supported]] for the [[deafblind]] community,<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://support.google.com/a/answer/1217728 |title=Archived copy |access-date=May 11, 2020 |archive-date=August 6, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200806173938/https://support.google.com/a/answer/1217728 |url-status=live }}</ref> effectively locking such users out of all pages that use the service. However, reCAPTCHA does currently have the longest list of accessibility considerations of any CAPTCHA service.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://blog.teamtreehouse.com/wcag-1-1-text-alternatives |title=WCAG 1.1: Text Alternatives &#91;Article&#93; |date=October 6, 2020 |access-date=December 10, 2020 |archive-date=November 26, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201126104424/https://blog.teamtreehouse.com/wcag-1-1-text-alternatives |url-status=live }}</ref>

=== Interface ===
In one of the variants of CAPTCHA challenges, images are not incrementally highlighted, but fade out when clicked, and replaced with a new image fading in, resembling [[whack-a-mole]].

Criticism has been aimed at the long duration taken for the images to fade out and in.<ref name=GitHub-fading>{{cite web |title=ReCaptcha extremly &#91;sic&#93; slow fading Â· Issue #268 Â· google/recaptcha |url=https://github.com/google/recaptcha/issues/268 |website=GitHub |language=en |access-date=October 14, 2020 |archive-date=October 14, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201014144316/https://github.com/google/recaptcha/issues/268 |url-status=live }}</ref>

== Derivative projects ==
reCAPTCHA had also created project Mailhide, which protects [[email address]]es on web pages from being [[e-mail address harvesting|harvested]] by [[e-mail spam|spammers]].<ref name="Mailhide" />  By default, the email address was converted into a format that did not allow a [[web crawler|crawler]] to see the full email address; for example, "mailme@example.com" would have been converted to "mai...@example.com". The visitor would then click on the "..." and solve the CAPTCHA in order to obtain the full email address. One could also edit the pop-up code so that none of the address was visible. Mailhide was discontinued in 2018 because it relied on reCAPTCHA v1.<ref name="MailhideDiscontinued" />
